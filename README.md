# Face-Recognition
This is a mini project done for the course SP 825 - Visual Recognition @ IIITB

Here, the Face Recognition is achieved using traditional methods (like PCA, LDA, LBP) and modern methods like OpenFace.
PCA here is implemented from the scratch and LDA, LBP were implemeted using Python Face Recognizer libraries.
The modern method OpenFace is implemeted using face_recognition library.
